# 🚚 Optimized Delivery Dispatching System

An intelligent and efficient solution designed to streamline vehicle dispatching, optimize delivery routes, and enhance driver productivity using advanced algorithms and cloud-based technologies.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Intelligent Route Optimization:** Utilizes Google's OR-Tools to calculate optimal delivery routes, minimizing distance and balancing driver workloads.
- **Real-time Dispatch Management:** Allows dispatchers to easily manage, upload, and modify delivery schedules through an intuitive interface.
- **Driver Mobile Application:** Provides drivers with clear daily delivery schedules, route details, and real-time notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
- **Advanced Analytics:** Tracks and visualizes delivery metrics, driver efficiency, and monthly accumulated salaries based on distances traveled.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Flutter & FlutterFlow for a beautiful, responsive, and cross-platform UI (iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop).
- **Backend:** Python (Flask) running on Google Cloud Run, integrating Google's OR-Tools for route optimization.
- **Database & Storage:** Firebase Firestore for real-time data storage and synchronization.
- **Authentication & Security:** Firebase Authentication and App Check ensure secure, authorized access.
- **Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for real-time driver notifications.
